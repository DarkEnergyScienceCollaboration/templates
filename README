The directory structure and files in this package are intended to serve as a
template for other LSST packages.  This package should never be installed or
built.

All occurrences of TMPL should be replaced by the name of the package, either

appropriate.


ISSUES:
__init__.py in both python/lsst/A and python/lsst/A/B?
